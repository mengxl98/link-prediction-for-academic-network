The goal of the project is to further my understandings of the current status of knowledge representation algorithms in solving link prediction problems for academic network. In this project, I am trying to infer missing links in an observed academic knowledge graph and compare the results of diﬀerent algorithm.
I use the NetworkX, which is a Python language software package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. There are many model in the NetworkX for link prediction, and I mainly use the methods based on node neighborhoods, such as common neighbors, Adamic-Adar index and resource allocation. These methods assign a connection weight score(x,y) to pairs of nodes hx,yi, based on the input graph Gcollab, and then produce a ranked list in decreasing order of score(x,y). Thus, they can be viewed as computing a measure of proximity or ‘similarity’ between nodes x and y, relative to the network topology.
